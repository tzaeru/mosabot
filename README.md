# mosabot
Discord bot as used by Mosam√§ki, subject to abrupt changes. Get weather, manage roles, all the jazz!

Requires Python3.5 (or above)

Based on the Discord API wrapper for Python: https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py

Weather data provided by Apixu. Uses Apixy Python wrapper: https://github.com/apixu/apixu-python

After installing the above, you need to have a Discord app/bot and join it to your server. See: https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token  
Once that is done, you need to get your Apixu key. Create an account at https://www.apixu.com/ and login.  
Rename config.py.example to config.py. Now you can insert your bot token and Apixu key to config.py.

Run with "python bot.py".

Have fun!
